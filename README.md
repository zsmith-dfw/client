### `Instructions`

The purpose of this application is for a user to create login information and sign up for college courses.<br />
After a user has registered, they can create a course by clicking the "create course" button. A title and description is required - the time and materials fields are optional.<br />
From there, a user can make an update or even delete their course if it is no longer needed. It should be noted that only the authenticated user that orginally created the course will have the ability to make updates and deletions.<br />
Any user will be able to see the details of another user's course but will not have access to update or delete it.<br />
Markdown support is implemented in the description and materials fields.<br />
In order to access the SQL lite database, it is required to run this client app alongside the included API.<br />
